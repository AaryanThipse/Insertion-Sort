# Insertion-Sort<br>
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.<br>
<b><ins>Characteristics of Insertion Sort:</b></ins><br>
1.This algorithm is one of the simplest algorithm with simple implementation<br>
2.Basically, Insertion sort is efficient for small data values<br>
3.Insertion sort is adaptive in nature, i.e. it is appropriate for data sets which are already partially sorted.<br>
